  ## Description
  A C# console application to make a store notes. This is the second step in my journey to learn C#. I decided to go with a switch/ case instead of an if/else block like my last effort to provide a better flow with less clutter.
  The out keyword is a completely new concept for me, javaScript that I am most familiar with doesn't have a simialr concept. Hopefully as I look back at these projects I'll be able to see a clear progression in 
  my coding maturity. In this industry you never stop learning, and that's one of my favorite things about it

  ## Installation
  Fork and run from the command line in Visual Studio or a similar IDE
  
  ## Future Development
  This could be paired with an attractive front end and connected to a database so you'd have persistent storage. It could be paired with local storage but would be far more useful with a database so you could maintain your 
  notes across platforms
